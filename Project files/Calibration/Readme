Using a multimeter, we calibrated the microcontroller reading according to the multimeter reading.
Then using a python program (which is in the Codes folder -> "Function_generator.py"), we generated an equation for microcontroller reading and actual reading.
Since we used voltage dividing method, the two readings are almost same. To avoid the small errors, we followed same steps as above.
